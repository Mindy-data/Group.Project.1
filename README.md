# Group.Project.1

As a group we set out to see the impact of the pandemic on movies and movie theatres. As we went looking for data sets that contained this information we quickly learned that there was no one comprehensive data set on the topic. 

So, Riley pulled a huge file of movie data by date using an api from https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-movie. He cleaned the data and compiled a data frame that included: movie titles, year realeased and revenues. From this data frame he created multiple charts to show revenue by month and year. In addition, he utilized: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/a698qx/using_the_imdb_api_to_download_2018_film_data_and/ to gain insight in the api and how best to pull the information we were looking for. 

Jose focused on stock price data that he pulled from https://finance.yahoo.com/. He also gathered coronavirus data from https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer. This particular csv file was too large to push to our repository. He created multiple charts for publicly traded movie and movie theatre companies. 

Erica pulled data regarding streaming services from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mauryansshivam/netflix-ott-revenue-and-subscribers. In addition she shared the website: https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.istockphoto.com%2Fphotos%2Fwatching-movie&psig=AOvVaw2FnppBlQ-z7I2ZxVkp3lQP&ust=1700272268887000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCJiQ2fn1yYIDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE which is were we took our stock photos for our presentation. She created multiple charts that showed Netflix's revenues and membership numbers over the same period of time that we were looking at.
